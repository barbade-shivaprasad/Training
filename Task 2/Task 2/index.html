            Imagine an international gateway where goods and merchandise flow
            across borders. Where countries lower taxes, reduce red tape, and
            eliminate road blocks. Where companies import goods and merchandise
            directly into a Free Trade Zone - and then ship products out duty
            free.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Miami Free Trade Zone connects North America, Europe and Asia to
            Latin America and the Caribbean via direct air and sea
            transportation links, plus rail and expressway. Operated by FTZ
            World Services, the 47-acre Zone (#372) saves companies money and
            time.

            facilities and a stellar track record in zone management, plus
            technological support, warehousing, and storage. Because FTZ
